        Hi, my name is Jackson Norris. I am a front-end web developer with undergraduate Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill and am working towards a Certificate in Full-stack development. Skilled with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and have experience in Java, C, Python, and SQL. I am passionate about solving challenging problems and approaching new material to further develop my abilities. Iâ€™ve successfully developed and maintained eCommerce websites run on Netsuite, WordPress, and Shopify, and also have past experience in marketing and working with graphic designers. I enjoy building powerful, yet simple tools that look to accomplish as much as possible while using few resources. I do enjoy working with companies involved in eCommerce and working on content that users get to see and interact with.
